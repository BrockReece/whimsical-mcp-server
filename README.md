# Whimsical MCP Server
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/BrockReece/whimsical-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/BrockReece/whimsical-mcp-server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables the creation of Whimsical diagrams programmatically. This server integrates with Whimsical's API to generate diagrams from Mermaid markup.

## Demo

Here's an example of a complex system architecture diagram created using this MCP server and Claude - it shows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture itself:
